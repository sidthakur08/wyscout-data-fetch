## Data Source
 [Wyscout Open Data](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000)
 - Soccer analytics is attracting an increasing interest of academia and industry, thanks to the availability of sensing technologies that provide high-fidelity data streams extracted from every match. Unfortunately, these detailed data are owned by specialized companies and hence are rarely publicly available for scientific research. To fill this gap, we provide to the public the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, collected by [Wyscout](https://wyscout.com/) containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) that occur during all matches of an entire season of seven competitions (La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Premier League, Ligue 1, FIFA World Cup 2018, UEFA Euro Cup 2016). A match event contains information about its position, time, outcome, player and characteristics.

### What this repo contains?
This repository contains a collection of json and csv files of players, teams, competitions, coaches, matches and events from different leagues and competitions fetched and available to download.
